A framework to collect YouTube QoS-QoE datasets by controlled experimentation.

QoS -> Network Quality of Service features e.g. bandwidth, delay, packet loss.

QoE -> The Quality of Experience for the given playout. The labels are based on application level measurements of join_time and stalling events.

The dataset can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MTmvOuKBE85XFyYQJBrABd2K-OOcwwVi
